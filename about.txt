Original connection string: "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=MinimalApiUserDb;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"

Trust Server Certificate=False
Application Intent=ReadWrite
Multi Subnet Failover=False
